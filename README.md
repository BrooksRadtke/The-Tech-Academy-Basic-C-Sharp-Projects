# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Hello! This repository contains many examples of C# exercises I worked on during my time at the Tech Academy. Please feel free to preview the projects and their brief descriptions below:

___

### [CarInsurance](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/CarInsurance)
This project is a more complex exercise utilizing the Entity Framework with an MVC model. A database is created from user input through the website, and business logic calulates the final monthly quote of the insuree. This also includes an Admin page view of database entries. 

### [CodeFirstStudentDatabase](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/CodeFirstStudentDatabase)
This project uses the Code-First approach to create a database with the Entity Framework.

#### [BooleanLogic](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLogic)
A brief exercise in boolean operators

#### [BooleanLoops](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLoops)
An exercise on boolean loops, including while, do-while, switches.

#### [Branching](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLoops)
An introduction to branching with if statements, and includes an terniary operator.

#### [ConsoleApp](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ConsoleApp)
This project contains a series of simple programming challenges, including creating a 1-Dimensional string using a For loop to print items and user input, displaying how to create an infinite loop, creating a comparison loop, using a boolean loop that prints all items of a list, creating a that searches through a list and displays the matching indexes, and using a foreach loop to check for duplicates in a list.

#### [ConsoleMathChallenge](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ConsoleMathChallenge)
A simple, and friendly, console application that performs basic math on user input.

#### [Enums](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/Enums)
This small project explores the use of enums, which are used to be checked with user input.

#### [ExceptionHandling](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ExceptionHandling)
An introductory exercise to Try/Catch exceptions based on user input for simple math operations.

#### [ExceptionHandlingApp](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ExceptionHandlingApp)
An additional exercise expanding on exception handling, which includes a list of numbers where each item is divided by user input. 

#### [File IO](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/File%20IO)
An introduction to using System.IO which creates a .txt file featuring the user input, and print's the file back to the user.
