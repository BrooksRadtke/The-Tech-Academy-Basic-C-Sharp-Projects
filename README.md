# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Hello! This repository contains many examples of C# exercises I worked on during my time at the Tech Academy. Please feel free to preview the projects and their brief descriptions below:

#### [ACME Accounting](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ACME%20Accounting)
A simple exercise regarding early understanding of escapes sequences in strings.

#### [AbstractClass](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/AbstractClass)
A brief exercise in using abstract classes and polymorphism by creating two objects, and printing lists as it relates to each object. 

#### [ArraysAndLists](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ArraysAndLists)
A simple exercise working with creating and modifying values in arrays and lists.

#### [BooleanLogic](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLogic)
A brief exercise in boolean operators

#### [BooleanLoops](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLoops)
An exercise on boolean loops, including while, do-while, switches.

#### [Branching](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/BooleanLoops)
An introduction to branching with if statements, and includes an terniary operator.

#### [CarInsurance](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/CarInsurance)
This project is a more complex exercise utilizing the Entity Framework with an MVC model. A database is created from user input through the website, and business logic calulates the final monthly quote of the insuree. This also includes an Admin page view of database entries. 

#### [CodeFirstStudentDatabase](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/CodeFirstStudentDatabase)
This project uses the Code-First approach to create a database with the Entity Framework.

#### [ConsoleApp](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ConsoleApp)
This project contains a series of simple programming challenges, including creating a 1-Dimensional string using a For loop to print items and user input, displaying how to create an infinite loop, creating a comparison loop, using a boolean loop that prints all items of a list, creating a that searches through a list and displays the matching indexes, and using a foreach loop to check for duplicates in a list.

#### [ConsoleMathChallenge](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ConsoleMathChallenge)
A simple, and friendly, console application that performs basic math on user input.

#### [ConstVar](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20C%23%20Programs/ConstVar)
A simple exercise using datatypes const and var, while also using chained constructors.
